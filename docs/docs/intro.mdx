## ðŸŸ¢ Real-Time Event Streaming (SSE)

Playwright MCP Server now supports real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

- The server exposes an SSE endpoint at `http://localhost:3001/events`.
- You can connect to this endpoint using any SSE-compatible client (such as EventSource in the browser or curl).
- Events are sent in real-time as they occur (e.g., new console logs, screenshots, etc.).

**Example (JavaScript):**
```js
const evtSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3001/events');
evtSource.addEventListener('console_log_entry', (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Console log:', data.log);
});
evtSource.addEventListener('screenshot', (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Screenshot event:', data);
});
```

**Available Events:**
- `console_log_entry`: Fired when a new console log is captured.
- `console_logs`: Fired when all logs are requested.
- `screenshot`: Fired when a screenshot is taken or requested.

This allows you to build real-time dashboards, monitoring tools, or simply observe browser activity as it happens.
